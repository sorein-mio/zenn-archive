This repository is used to manage and publish articles on [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/) using [Zenn CLI](https://github.com/zenn-dev/zenn-editor) and GitHub. Primarily, it's a place to share code I've created and record what I've learned. This serves as a personal archive that others can also learn from. They are then synced with Zenn for publication. Click [here](https://zenn.dev/naoki0103) for details.
